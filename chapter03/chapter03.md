# 03: Recap

## The big ideas so far

> TDD stands for Test-Driven Development

> Tests are executable specifications

> **Test behaviour, not implementation**

> We write tests first in TDD - always

> Tests have three sections documenting setup, use, results

> Test-first is a driver towards modularity and ease-of-use

> Testing logic is one by-product of TDD

> We build up a large suite of automated tests

## TDD Benefits

- Code is specified before writing
- Executable Specifications
- Fast feeback on ease of use of programming interface
- Documentation
- Example code provided in tests
- Automates testing of code once written
- Simple to prove correct behaviour for edge cases
- Confidence durng refactoring
- Regression testing - ensuring new code does not break old code
- Speeds up debugging (faster to run code to debug)
