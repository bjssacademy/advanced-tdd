# advanced-tdd

## Introduction

Through this material, we will learn what TDD is by building a Battleships game.

We'll be looking at what TDD is, and is not, and exploring alternatives along the way. We start with the very basics of what benefits we hope TDD brings, and then onto how to structure and write out first test. We will go on to the rhytms of TDD.

As TDD is all about encouraging and experimenting with software design, we will be covering advanced aspects of TDD. These include using Dependency Inversion and test doubles, and how to design our codebase to decouple it from difficult to test external systems.

By the end, we should be comfortable in understanding what TDD is, how it can be applied to our work, and the benefits it can bring.

This material supports the content in the BJSS Academy Intro to TDD in the Engineering Foundation Course, and also the Level 6 TDD Apprenticeship sessions.
